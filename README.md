# Octanet-python-development-internship

This project is developed during my PYTHON DEVELOPMENT internship at OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd.

This project consists of two Python classes, BankAccount and ATM, designed to simulate basic banking operations. The BankAccount class represents a simple bank account with functionalities for checking balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds. The ATM class serves as an interface to interact with a BankAccount object, providing a menu-driven system for users to perform operations.
